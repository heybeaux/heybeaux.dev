# Hello World

First post on the new site. Felt weird not to have something here.

## Why Write?

I've been building things for years but rarely documenting any of it. That changes now. A few reasons:

1. **Rubber ducking** — Writing forces me to actually understand what I did
2. **Future me** — I'll forget how this all works in 6 months
3. **Maybe useful** — If I struggled with something, others probably did too

## What to Expect

No specific niche. I work on a lot of different things:

- Full-stack dev (React, Node, whatever's needed)
- Salesforce work (don't judge)
- AI/LLM experiments
- Random projects that probably won't make money

I'll write about whatever I'm building or learning. Some posts will be technical deep-dives with code. Others will be shorter takes or lessons learned.

## How This Site Works

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build). Content lives in markdown files. No CMS, no database, just files in a repo. The way it should be.

The design is called "The Workbench" — clean, functional, a bit industrial. Orange accents because I like orange.

## Let's Go

That's it. First post done. More coming as I build stuff.
