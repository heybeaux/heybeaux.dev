# Anti-Kaizen: ADHD, AI, and the Art of Working With Your Brain

Years ago, when I worked for Kintec — a footwear and orthoses specialist in Vancouver — they brought in a motivational speaker for our Christmas party. He introduced us to the Japanese concept of **Kaizen**: continuous improvement through small, incremental changes.

The idea is elegant. Each day, you make something just a little bit better. It doesn't matter how small the improvement. Over time, these tiny gains compound into massive transformation.

I sat in that room nodding along, genuinely inspired. Then I went back to my life and promptly forgot about it for six months.

Because here's the thing about ADHD that Kaizen doesn't account for:

**My brain runs on Anti-Kaizen.**

## The Incremental Chaos Engine

Where Kaizen promises steady improvement, ADHD delivers steady entropy. Not dramatic failures — tiny regressions. Death by a thousand paper cuts you don't remember getting.

The email that needed a response three days ago? It's still sitting there, marked unread for the fourth time because "unread" is supposed to mean "deal with this" but your brain stopped believing that lie months ago.

The task you committed to memory mid-conversation? It evaporated somewhere between "I'll definitely do that" and walking to your desk.

The context you had on that project yesterday? Gone. You know you knew this. You can feel the ghost of understanding. But the actual information has moved on.

This isn't forgetfulness. It's not laziness. It's not a character flaw. It's a brain that processes, prioritizes, and stores information differently — and often inconveniently.

## Why Traditional Tools Don't Work

Every productivity guru has the same advice: use a calendar, keep a to-do list, write things down.

I've tried them all:
- **Calendars**: I have four. None of them get checked regularly.
- **To-do apps**: Todoist, Things, Notion, Apple Reminders, sticky notes. Each one is a monument to abandoned good intentions.
- **Notebooks**: I've bought beautiful notebooks. I've started journaling systems. Every single notebook is lost, half-filled, or forgotten in a drawer.

The fundamental problem is that these tools assume you'll **remember to use them**. They require consistent engagement with a system — exactly the thing ADHD makes unreliable.

It's not that I don't want to be organized. It's that the organizational overhead itself becomes another thing that falls through the cracks.

## Enter the Conversation

I didn't set out to use AI as an ADHD tool. It started as curiosity about the technology. But somewhere along the way, I noticed something changing.

The difference between a to-do app and a conversational AI is subtle but profound: **I don't have to remember to use it. I just... talk to it.**

When a thought crosses my mind, I share it. When I lose context on a project, I ask. When I need to remember something, I say it out loud and trust that it's captured.

Case in point: I have a React Native app called UltraEdge — a planning tool for endurance athletes. The repo sat untouched for six months. Not because I didn't care about it. I *loved* the idea. But every time I opened the codebase, I'd lost all context. Where was I? What still needed doing? What decisions had I already made and forgotten?

The activation energy to re-enter the project was higher than the energy I had. So it sat there. Another abandoned repo. Another victim of Anti-Kaizen.

Then I started working with an AI assistant. Within a week, we'd shipped five complete modules. We're now targeting an App Store launch by end of February.

Same project. Same me. Different environment.

This week alone, I lost the thread on that project at least a dozen times. Context vanished between messages. I forgot what I'd already fixed. I circled back to the same bug twice because I didn't remember solving it the first time.

But each time, I could just ask: "Where were we?" And pick it back up.

At one point, a save button refused to appear. We traced through the layout together — not "fix this for me," but "what are we missing?" Turned out the footer was being pushed off-screen by flex behavior. We found it, fixed it, and I actually understood why.

That's the difference. I'm not outsourcing my brain. I'm extending it.

## The Key Insight: Complement, Don't Replace

Here's what I've learned that most "AI productivity" advice misses:

**AI isn't a replacement for how you work. It's a complement to it.**

I don't dump work on my AI and walk away. That would just create a different kind of chaos. Instead, I work *with* it. I explain my thinking, ask questions, review its suggestions, learn from the interactions.

When we were debugging that missing save button, I didn't say "fix it for me." I said "the button isn't showing — what are we missing?" We traced through the layout together, identified that the footer was being pushed off-screen by flex behavior, and fixed it collaboratively.

I learned something. The fix stuck. And next time I'll recognize that pattern faster.

This isn't about outsourcing your brain. It's about extending it.

## Engineering Your Environment

There's a concept in disability studies called the "social model of disability." It argues that disability isn't inherent to a person — it emerges from the mismatch between a person and their environment.

A wheelchair user isn't disabled by their legs. They're disabled by stairs.

ADHD isn't a failure to fit productivity systems. It's a mismatch between how our brains work and how most systems are designed.

The solution isn't to force yourself into systems that don't fit. It's to engineer environments that do.

For me, that environment now includes:
- A conversational AI that holds context when I can't
- Voice memos instead of written notes
- Working in intense bursts instead of steady hours
- Building in public so external accountability exists
- Embracing the hyperfocus when it arrives instead of fighting for "balance"

## Anti-Kaizen, Meet Counter-Balance

I'm not cured. I still lose things. I still forget. I still have days where the executive dysfunction wins and nothing gets done.

But the trend line has shifted.

Instead of Anti-Kaizen — where tiny regressions compound into chaos — I now have a counter-balance. Something that catches the small things before they become big things. Something that remembers when I don't.

Kaizen promised continuous improvement. I couldn't achieve it alone.

But I'm not alone anymore.
