## The Vision

Run As You Are was about taking Vancouver Running Company — a beloved local run specialty store — and turning it into something bigger. Not a chain of stores, but a global community of runners connected through shared values and digital ownership.

This was 2022, peak NFT era. But we weren't trying to make a quick buck on speculation. The question was: can we use this technology to create genuine membership value?

## What I Did

### Project Coordination

- Worked with founders, designers, and developers to bring the rebrand to life
- Managed timelines and deliverables across multiple workstreams
- Coordinated with partners including On Running for flagship events

### Brand Activations

**NFT.NYC — On Running Flagship, NYC**
We set up shop at On's NYC flagship during NFT.NYC. Runners could come in, learn about RAYA, and experience the intersection of running culture and Web3.

**Vancouver RFID Event**
This one was wild. We had custom shoes with RFID tags embedded. When members scanned their shoes, it triggered unique NFT animations. Physical meets digital in a way that actually made sense for runners.

### Frontend Development

I also shipped frontend work — building pieces of the web presence that supported the membership experience.

## Tech Stack

- **NFT/Web3**: Ethereum-based membership tokens
- **RFID**: Custom hardware integration for physical-digital experiences  
- **POAP**: Proof of Attendance Protocol for event participation
- **Discord**: Community building and member engagement
- **React**: Frontend development

## What I Learned

Web3 in 2022 was the Wild West. A lot of projects were pure speculation — cash grabs with no underlying value.

What made RAYA different was legitimacy. We weren't anon founders launching a JPEG collection. We were backed by an established brick-and-mortar business with years of community trust. Vancouver Running Company had real customers, real relationships, real reputation. That foundation meant we could experiment with Web3 without it feeling like a scam.

The design intention was solid: use emerging tech to enhance an existing community, not manufacture a fake one. The RFID shoe activation was a highlight — when you see someone scan their shoe and watch their unique animation appear, you realize the tech isn't the point. It's the experience it enables.

## Where It Went

The NFT market cooled significantly, but Run As You Are continues as a membership program. The tech evolved, but the community remains.
