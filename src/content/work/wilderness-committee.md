name: "Wilderness Committee"
role: "Digital Fundraising Coordinator"
period: "2019 — 2022"
status: "completed"
externalLink: "https://wildernesscommittee.org"
tech: ["Salesforce", "Pardot", "Shopify", "FormAssembly", "Apsona", "Conga"]
challenge: "I was hired into a brand new role, mid-Salesforce migration. The org had ambitious fundraising goals but was drowning in disconnected systems — Salesforce, Pardot, Shopify, FormAssembly, and more — with no one really owning the technical side."
solution: "I became that person. Took ownership of Salesforce admin, development, and automation. Built integrations between all the systems. Created a formal data management plan. Worked hand-in-hand with donor relations to understand what they actually needed."
outcome: "40% fewer lost monthly donors over my tenure. The data management plan I built still guides the organization today. Left the digital infrastructure in a place where the next person could actually build on it instead of fighting it."

## How It Started vs. How It Went

**The job posting**: Digital Fundraising Coordinator
**What I actually did**: Salesforce admin, developer, and integration architect for a 40+ year old environmental nonprofit

The Wilderness Committee is Canada's largest membership-based wilderness preservation organization. They've been fighting for old-growth forests and endangered species since 1980. When I joined, they were mid-migration to Salesforce, and nobody really knew how to make all the pieces work together.

## What I Built

### Salesforce Everything

- **Admin**: Users, permissions, custom objects, the works
- **Development**: Custom Apex when the point-and-click tools couldn't cut it
- **Automation**: Flows, Process Builder (RIP), scheduled jobs

### System Integrations

The nonprofit tech stack is a special kind of chaos:

- **Pardot** for email marketing and lead nurturing
- **Shopify** for the online store
- **FormAssembly** for donation forms and surveys
- **Apsona** for bulk data operations
- **Conga** for document generation

I built and maintained the integrations that kept data flowing between all of these.

### Data Management

Created a formal data management plan — who owns what data, how it's updated, what the source of truth is. The boring stuff that prevents chaos.

## The Results

The number I'm proudest of: **40% reduction in monthly donor churn** over my two years there. That wasn't just tech — it was working closely with donor relations to understand when people were at risk of leaving and making sure someone reached out.

## Lessons Learned

- Nonprofits are under-resourced and over-ambitious. That's not a bug, it's the nature of mission-driven work.
- "We just need someone to set up Salesforce" means "we need you to be IT, ops, and data for the next two years."
- The best technical solutions come from understanding the humans using them.
