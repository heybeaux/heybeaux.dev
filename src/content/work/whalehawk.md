period: "2023 — Present"
status: "active"
externalLink: "https://whalehawk.com"
tech: ["Apex", "Lightning Web Components", "React", "Salesforce", "Node.js"]
challenge: "Medical device sales is a grind. Reps spend hours researching prospects — digging through LinkedIn, news articles, conference panels — just to figure out if someone's worth calling. The good ones do this well. Most don't have the time."
solution: "WhaleHawk does the research for you. AI-powered intelligence that surfaces buying signals, prioritizes accounts, and gives reps talking points tailored to each prospect. I built the Salesforce integration that brings it all into the CRM where reps actually work."
outcome: "The platform is live and growing. Reps are spending less time on research and more time on conversations that matter. The Salesforce integration means they don't have to leave their workflow to use it."

## My Role

I work across the full stack at WhaleHawk:

- **Landing Site**: The marketing face of the product. Built for speed and conversion.
- **Web App**: The core intelligence platform where the magic happens.
- **Salesforce Integration**: This is my baby. Apex and Lightning Web Components that bring WhaleHawk's insights directly into Salesforce.

## The Salesforce Piece

Writing Apex is... interesting. It's like Java if Java was designed by someone who really wanted to sell you enterprise licenses. But Salesforce is where medical device sales teams live, so that's where we needed to be.

The integration syncs prospect intelligence, surfaces relevant signals on record pages, and lets reps take action without context-switching. Lightning Web Components for the UI, Apex for the backend logic, and a lot of careful attention to governor limits.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**: React for the web app, LWC for Salesforce
**Backend**: Node.js services, Apex for SF-native functionality
**Data**: A lot of web scraping, NLP, and AI orchestration happening behind the scenes

## What I've Learned

Healthcare sales is its own world. The buying cycles are long, the stakeholders are many, and the regulations are real. Building for this space means understanding not just the tech, but the humans using it.
