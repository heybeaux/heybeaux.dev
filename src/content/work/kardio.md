name: "Kardio"
role: "Director of Product & Development"
period: "2022 — 2025"
status: "completed"
tech: ["React Native", "D3.js", "TestFlight", "GitHub Actions", "Supabase"]
challenge: "Heart health apps are either boring medical utilities or fitness trackers that don't speak to casual users. Kardio's vision was different: make heart health engaging through gamification, community, and a distinctive pixel-art aesthetic."
solution: "I grew from PM into leading both product and development. Built out proper test suites and CI/CD pipelines that cut deployment time from weeks to under 10 minutes. Shaped the product direction while shipping code myself."
outcome: "Successfully launched on the App Store. Built a sustainable development process that let a small team ship with confidence. Learned that the line between 'product' and 'engineering' is mostly artificial."

## The Journey

I joined Kardio as a Product Manager. That title lasted about a month.

The startup needed someone who could both shape what we were building AND help build it. So that's what I did. By the end, I was Director of Product & Development — which really meant "person responsible for making sure we ship good things."

## What Made Kardio Different

### Pixel Art Aesthetic

Most health apps look like medical equipment. Kardio looked like a game you'd actually want to play. The pixel-art style wasn't just aesthetic — it signaled that this wasn't your doctor's app.

### Gamification That Works

Points, levels, avatars, challenges. But not gamification as manipulation — gamification as motivation. The mechanics were designed around genuine engagement with heart health, not dark patterns.

### Community First

Heart health can be isolating. Kardio built community challenges that let people support each other. Competition when you wanted it, encouragement always.

## Technical Wins

### CI/CD Pipeline

When I joined, deployments took weeks. Manual testing, manual builds, manual everything. 

I built out:
- Automated test suites that caught issues before they shipped
- GitHub Actions pipelines for consistent builds
- TestFlight integration for seamless beta distribution

Result: deployment time dropped from weeks to under 10 minutes.

### Data Visualization

Heart rate data is inherently visual. Using D3.js, we built visualizations that made the data meaningful — not just numbers on a screen, but patterns you could understand at a glance.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile development
- **D3.js**: Data visualization for heart rate trends
- **Supabase**: Backend services and database
- **TestFlight**: iOS beta distribution
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation

## Lessons Learned

**The PM/Engineer divide is often artificial.** The best product decisions come from people who understand both what users need AND what's technically feasible. Don't silo yourself.

**Invest in infrastructure early.** That CI/CD pipeline paid for itself within weeks. When you can ship with confidence, you ship more often.

**Gamification is a tool, not a strategy.** Points and badges mean nothing if the underlying experience isn't valuable. Start with genuine value, then ask how game mechanics can enhance it.

## Where It Is Now

Kardio has sunset. The app was taken down from the App Store in 2025. But the work mattered — we proved that heart health apps don't have to be boring, and the CI/CD practices I built there still inform how I ship software today.
