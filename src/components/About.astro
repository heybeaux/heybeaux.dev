      I spent years fixing vehicles in the <strong>Australian Army</strong>. Now I fix problems with code. 
      The skillset transfers better than you'd think — diagnose, prototype, ship, iterate.

      <span class="text-[var(--color-accent)] font-medium">I don't specialize.</span> I have whatever you need built. 
      If it involves making computers do useful things, I'm interested.

      I'm currently building tools for people 
      who'd rather ship than sit in meetings.
