      I got my first computer at 5. By 14, I was studying IT at a technical college. 
      By 17, I had a university offer before I'd finished high school.

      I dropped out. Too much theory, not enough building.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So I built things anyway — just not software. I fixed vehicles in the <strong>Australian Army</strong>. 
      I repped the fastest-growing running brand in Western Canada. I worked a dozen jobs that taught me 
      how to learn anything, fast.

      When my wife got pregnant with our first, I bet on myself. Turns out the kid who kept breaking 
      his dad's computer could actually ship code for a living.

      Whether that's React, Salesforce, AI tools, or something I'll learn next week.
