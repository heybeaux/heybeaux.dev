      I spent years fixing vehicles in the Canadian Army. Now I fix problems with code. 
      The skillset transfers better than you'd think—diagnose, prototype, ship, iterate.

      I don't specialize. I have whatever you need built. Web apps, automation, 
      integrations, the unglamorous stuff that actually makes businesses run. 
      If it involves making computers do useful things, I'm interested.

      Currently doing fractional CTO work and building tools for people 
      who'd rather ship than sit in meetings.
